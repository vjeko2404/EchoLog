# EchoLog – Extended System Overview

EchoLog is a standalone backend system meticulously crafted to facilitate the tracking, analysis, and comprehensive lifecycle management of technical projects spanning software, hardware, firmware, and interdisciplinary engineering domains. The system is built upon a foundation of robust role-based access control (RBAC), secure authentication protocols, and a data segmentation strategy that respects resource ownership.

It is crucial to understand that EchoLog is not intended as a conventional "collaboration tool." Instead, it serves as an engineering intelligence core, specifically engineered to support isolated, individual, or strictly controlled environments where the paramount concerns are data integrity, granular access control, and meticulous traceability.

## Core Objectives

**Ownership-Enforced Project Management:**
At the core of EchoLog's design is the principle of project ownership. Each project and its associated data—including files, architectural details, identified bugs, and notes—is explicitly linked to the user responsible for it. Unless explicitly granted elevated privileges (as with observer or administrator roles), users are strictly prohibited from accessing or modifying projects they do not own.

**Local-First, API-Exposed Architecture:**
EchoLog operates independently of cloud services, external APIs, or third-party identity providers. The system is architected for local deployment, such as on a Raspberry Pi or embedded servers, offering complete database portability and straightforward path-based configuration.

**RBAC Enforcement at the API Layer:**
Every API endpoint within EchoLog is protected by rigorous role-based access control checks:
- **Admin:** Possesses unrestricted control over all users, system settings, and data.
- **User:** Has full privileges to manage their own project-related data.
- **Observer:** Is granted read-only visibility across the entire system's public data.

**Zero-Dependency Bootstrap:**
Upon its initial execution, EchoLog autonomously initializes the database, applies any necessary migrations, seeds essential base configuration (including the API port, user roles, and the initial administrator account), and begins running on a dynamically determined yet persistent HTTP port, the value of which is stored within the database itself.

**JWT Authentication and Stateless Sessions:**
User authentication is performed via the `/api/auth/login` endpoint, which, upon successful verification, issues a signed JSON Web Token (JWT). Subsequent API requests are validated against this token. The system maintains a stateless architecture, eschewing cookies, session states, or reliance on external identity management platforms.

**Modular, Extensible Data Model:**
The underlying database schema is designed for future extensibility without requiring significant modifications. Related entities such as notes, files, statuses, and types are linked through normalized relationships, avoiding the complexities of arbitrary foreign key constraints. This design facilitates the seamless integration of future enhancements like tagging, dependency tracking, and metric collection.

**Frontend Highlights:**

- **Role-Responsive UI**: Admins see full controls, users see only their projects, and observers see—but cannot touch.
- **JWT-Persistent Sessions**: All user sessions are driven by stateless JWT auth, seamlessly integrated in the UI and request lifecycle.
- **Project Lifecycle Visualization**: Tabs for summary, detail, notes, and file uploads provide full audit-friendly breakdowns.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Enables full user management, role control, file category administration, app settings, and project ownership transfers.
- **File Handling Module**: Drag-and-drop multi-file uploads, metadata tagging, ZIP-based batch downloads, and server-side storage pathing.
- **Live Data Sync**: All changes instantly reflect in the UI through direct API interaction—no reloads, no guesswork.

**Precision Logging and Traceability:**
Every project within EchoLog meticulously captures:
- Critical lifecycle metadata, including timestamps and status transitions.
- Comprehensive technical summaries detailing architecture and known bugs.
- Supporting documentation in the form of attached files and notes.

This structured approach not only ensures robust historical traceability but also fosters engineering-grade context retention, proving invaluable for audits, reverse-engineering efforts, or post-mortem diagnostics.

## Target Use Cases

- Independent engineering laboratories
- High-trust prototyping environments
- Secure personal project management without cloud dependencies
- Distributed teams operating within firewalled networks
- Offline-only industrial or embedded system setups

### Use Cases: Expanded

EchoLog now serves not just developers and embedded engineers, but:

- System architects requiring structured documentation and version-safe note trails
- Security-sensitive operations that reject cloud-first products
- Offline teams needing a single source of project truth
- Lab environments where ownership and auditability must be explicit

## Architecture Status (as of 22.04.2025)

- Backend development is complete and rigorously secured.
- All data models have been normalized and their integrity enforced.
- JWT-based authentication and Swagger API documentation integration are finalized.
- Controllers have been hardened with comprehensive access control rules.
- The backend is now ready for integration with a frontend user interface or external client applications.

### Status – Ready for Deployment

- **Backend**: Hardened, RBAC-protected, tested under multiple role scenarios
- **Frontend**: Fully wired, role-reactive, responsive UI built with maintainability in mind
- **Database**: Extensible schema, all entities normalized, migration-safe
- **Deployment**: Local or embedded server setups supported out of the box

EchoLog transcends the limitations of a mere project management tool. It stands as a foundational framework for establishing technical ownership and accountability, engineered to scale from individual engineers to larger teams without sacrificing its core principles of efficiency and focused functionality.
