# EchoLog
Self-hosted project logbook and technical memory engine. Tracks systems, modules, fixes, devices, and architecture without cloud dependency.

# EchoLog

**EchoLog** is a self-hosted, low-footprint project memory engine built in .NET 8.  
It captures systems, modules, fixes, devices, and operational notes in a structured, queryable format‚Äîoptimized for personal engineering workflows, not corporate bloat.

## üîß Tech Stack

- **Backend**: .NET 8 Minimal API + SQLite
- **Frontend**: React (WIP)
- **Hosting**: Raspberry Pi / Linux / Windows compatible
- **Auth**: Local-only, role-based access (RBAC-ready)
- **Config**: Stored in DB‚Äîno `.env`, no external secrets

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- Structured project model: types, statuses, notes, files
- Local-first: all data, including config, stored inside SQLite
- Dynamic API port config via DB (`AppSetting`)
- Optional file upload per project
- Role-based user model (`admin`, `user`, extensible)

## üöÄ Roadmap

- [x] Backend model + DB architecture
- [x] Seeded roles, settings, user auth
- [ ] Project CRUD API
- [ ] Frontend UI
- [ ] Export/snapshot features
- [ ] Pi deployment script
